The recommended approach for configuring a message broker is using [Solace PubSub+ Manager]({{ site.links-docs-webadmin }}){:target="_top"}, Solace's browser-based administration console packaged with the Solace PubSub+ message broker. This document uses CLI as the reference to remain concise - look for related settings if using the administration console.

For reference, the CLI commands in this guide are from SolOS version 7.2 but will generally be forward compatible. For more details related to message broker CLI see [Solace-CLI]({{ site.links-docs-cli }}){:target="_top"}. Wherever possible, default values will be used to minimize the required configuration. The CLI commands listed also assume that the CLI user has a Global Access Level set to Admin. For details on CLI access levels please see [User Authentication and Authorization]({{ site.links-docs-user-authenticate-authorize }}){:target="_top"}.
